          Jigstack DAO has partnered with us to develop a comprehensive
          decentralized finance (DeFi) solution, including branding, application
          design, and a non-custodial wallet. Our collaboration began at the
          design phase and continued through the full product life cycle to
          ensure the best possible user experience. To achieve this goal, we
          focused on developing a user-friendly interface and pixel-perfect
          design. By working closely with Jigstack DAO throughout the project,
          we were able to deliver a high-quality, fully-fledged DeFi solution
          that meets the needs of our users.

          In order to showcase all of Jigstack's eight products on the home
          page, we implemented a scrolling feature in the hero section. As the
          user scrolls down the page, the highlighted product will change,
          allowing for an effective and visually appealing way to present all of
          the products to the user. This solution allows for an efficient use of
          space on the home page while still providing visibility for all of
          Jigstack's products.

            As a crypto staking platform, it was important to design a user
            interface that was intuitive and easy to use for our target
            audience. We began by conducting user research to understand the
            needs and goals of our users, as well as any potential pain points
            they might experience while using our platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            Based on this research, we created wireframes and prototypes to test
            and iterate on different design solutions. We also made sure to
            include clear calls to action and prominent buttons to allow users
            to easily initiate staking actions. Overall, our goal was to create
            a staking platform that was not only functional, but also visually
            appealing and enjoyable to use. By conducting user research and
            testing various design solutions, we were able to deliver a
            high-quality staking platform that met the needs of our users.

            The Jigstack Wallet has integrated DEX functionality allowing users
            to gain access to over 1900 coin pairs and over 1.7b worth of
            liquidity to swap with.
          </p>
          <p>
            To design the DEX feature, the Jigstack team conducted extensive
            user research to understand the needs and preferences of their
            target audience. They learned that users valued simplicity and ease
            of use, as well as strong security measures to protect their assets.
          </p>
          <p>
            With these insights in mind, the team designed a streamlined
            interface that made it easy for users to navigate and trade on the
            DEX. They also implemented robust security measures, such as
            two-factor authentication and cold storage, to ensure that users'
            assets were safe.

          <p>
            Having a wallet that is designed to be responsive ensures that the
            user experience is consistent and seamless, regardless of the device
            being used. It also makes it easier for users to manage their
            cryptocurrency holdings on the go, which can be especially important
            in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency trading.
